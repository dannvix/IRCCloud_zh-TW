IRCCloud 正體中文化
===================
[IRCCloud](http://irccloud.com) 是很棒的 IRC 掛站工具，但目前 (2013/08) 仍然只有英文介面。這個 Chrome extension 提供初步的 IRCCloud 正體中文化介面，希望降低新手上路門檻。

[IRCCloud](http://irccloud.com) is an awesome web-based IRC client which keeps the connections after the page closed. However, it comes with only English interface so far (Aug '13). This Chrome extension basically provides Traditional Chinese language pack for IRCCloud.
